            <p class="blah">
                Telehealth has picked up during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                and more medical practices start to integrate online patient visit into their business.
                At the same time, many doctors and hospitals still use hand-written files for records.
                Also, doctors need to assign medical codes to services provided for insurance purpose.
                With the growing complex medical code system, assiging codes become a laborous task that 
                is time-consuming and inducive to mistakes.
                <br><br>
                According to a <a href="https://mymedicalscore.com/medical-error-statistics/#:~:text=Top%20Health%20Statistics%201%20Medical%20billing%20errors%20cost,surgical%20errors%20occur%20each%20year.%20More%20items...%20" style="text-decoration: underline; color: black;">MyMedicalSore report</a>,
                inaccurate medical coding and erroneous billing cost Americans more than $2 billion annually, 
                and about 12 million Americans are misdiagnosed each year.
                The inefficicent system is costly and contributes to burn-outs among medical professionals.

                Knowtex is a startup that aims to use artificial intelligence 
                and voice recognition to help doctors take better visit notes 
                and more easily assign diagnosis and service medical codes. 
                Its goal is to ultimately allow doctors to be able to fully 
                focus on their patients in visits, 
                while the Knowtex AI application takes notes on the visit.

                My team aims to create a high-fidelity mock-up of Knowtex's product,
                which needs to have a smooth and intuitive workflow.
                We also need to make key design decision with respect to video and audio recording,
                patient record storage, AI note taking, and medical codes assignment.
                Ultimately, this application should be an effective assistance to doctors, 
                rather than an administrative burden.

                    target audience for the applicastion. In this case, 
                    the target audience would be medical professionals with online patient visits. 
                    Having had conversations with friends and relatives working in the medical field,
                    our team and I summarized key charactersitics of our potential users, and those are listed below.

            <h3>Critique and Iterative Design</h3>
            <p class="blah">
                The experience involved multiple rounds of iterative design with peer critique and user testing.
                Such cirtiques have revealed blind spots of design choices that none of the team members have noticed.
                <br>
                This taught me the importance of seeking and incorporating feedbacks from multiple perspectives when 
                designing a product.
            </p>
            <h3>Design of User Testing</h3>
            <p class="blah">
                A significant portion of confusion in user testing arose from illogical sequence of task assigned
                that doesn't correspond to the workflow of our prototype.
                Going forward, we will be more cautious about the design of user testing
                so that it's more inducive to feedbacks on product itself.
