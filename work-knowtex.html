                Telehealth has picked up during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                However, hospitals's record-management did not follow. 
                Doctors have to hand-write notes and manually assign medical codes.
                <br><br>
                According to a <a href="https://mymedicalscore.com/medical-error-statistics/#:~:text=Top%20Health%20Statistics%201%20Medical%20billing%20errors%20cost,surgical%20errors%20occur%20each%20year.%20More%20items...%20" style="text-decoration: underline; color: black;">MyMedicalSore report</a>,
                inaccurate medical coding and erroneous billing cost Americans more than $2 billion annually, 
                and about 12 million Americans are misdiagnosed each year.

                Knowtex is a startup that aims to use artificial intelligence 
                and voice recognition to help doctors take better visit notes 
                and more easily assign diagnosis and service medical codes, so that they can focus on the patients better.

                My team aims to create a high-fidelity mock-up of Knowtex's product,
                which needs to have a smooth and intuitive workflow.
                We also need to make key design decision with respect to video and audio recording,
                patient record storage, AI note taking, and medical codes assignment.
                Ultimately, this application should be an effective assistance to doctors, 
                rather than an administrative burden.

                            (like the log out button), 
                            but largely decided to keep — but simplify — 
                            the text on buttons, 
                            hopefully keeping the same formal feel while 
                            making it faster to navigate.

                            clarify flow, 
                            while keeping the “back” button in the top right of

                        <p> The reality of the healthcare system is that 
                            once records have been published to a patient’s 
                            medical record, they may not be altered or removed.
                            <br><br>
                            With this in mind, we chose not to allow editing / deleting a record after submission.
                            Instead, we added warnings to the interface to 
                            more clearly specify to users that once published, 
                            records cannot be edited or deleted.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Critique and Iterative Design</h3>
            <p class="blah">
                The experience involved multiple rounds of iterative design with peer critique and user testing.
                Such cirtiques have revealed blind spots of design choices that none of the team members have noticed.
                <br>
                This taught me the importance of seeking and incorporating feedbacks from multiple perspectives when 
                designing a product.
            </p>
            <h3>Design of User Testing</h3>
            <p class="blah">
                A significant portion of confusion in user testing arose from illogical sequence of task assigned
                that doesn't correspond to the workflow of our prototype.
                Going forward, we will be more cautious about the design of user testing
                so that it's more inducive to feedbacks on product itself.
