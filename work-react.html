                Many websites developed using html and css struggle with the redundancy of similar components,
                as well as programing interactive components. This can be solved by using React, which is a JavaScript Liabrary
                specifically designed for developing interactive web-based applications.
                <br><br>
                Having the website being interactive and have a uniform design across a large number of items 
                is essential for businesses, one application being the product catelog and the online ordering workflow.
                <br><br>
                This project will be a learning experience for me to explore the use of states and components
                in React, an essential part of interative web development.

                In this project, I seek to develop an interactive web-based application using React 
                for a fictional restaurant, "Golden Dragon Dim Sum Palace". 
                <br><br>
                The application will have filtering & sorting functionalities, a host of product offerings,
                and a shopping cart.

                    Drawing on real-life experiences, I have summarized the characteristics of those customers.

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p class="blah">Based on my study of existing restaurant ordering and online retailer's websites,
                I have summarized several key points that will be incorporated into my design.
            </p>
            <p class="sec-subtitle">Design Choices</p>
            <div class="row-start-container" id="design-choices">
                <div class="flex-container dc-item">
                    <h4>Filters</h4>
                    <p>Similar to restaurants using food categories to 
                        allow customers jumping to different sections of the menu,
                        my application will have filters based on attributes of food.
                        Given that the menu consists primarily of dim sum, I decided to
                        implement filter based on taste and cooking method.
                        <br><br>
                        Moreover, inspired by Macy's price filter, 
                        I decided to implement a min-max price filter. 
                        Since dim sum's prices are similar, I will use a slider for customers 
                        to input price range.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex-container dc-item">
                    <h4>Sort</h4>
                    <p>
                        I chose to implement sort based on price (low-to-high and high-to-low), 
                        considering the budgeting needs of potential customers.
                        Also, I added an alphabetical sort to help customers find their desired dish 
                        based on name. This feature is mostly for returning customers or those familiar
                        with dim sum already, such that they already know the dish names by heart.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex-container dc-item">
                    <h4>Shopping Cart</h4>
                    <p>
                        Similar to Plant City, my application will have the shopping cart on the side,
                        updating instantaneously. I made this choice because, unlike clothes shopping, 
                        customers usually edit the cart a lot, so a cart on the side will be much more
                        efficient for the editing process.
                        <br><br>
                        Also, the shopping cart will allow add/remove/remove-all directly from the cart,
                        so that customers won't need to repeat one action of add/remove.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex-container dc-item">
                    <h4>Button to Add Item</h4>
                    <p>
                        As the menu of this application is rather simple, I will add a button of "add-to-cart"
                        below each item. This is meant to clarify the process of adding to cart as much as possible.
                    </p>

                                and 3 sorting mechanisms based on price and product name using radio select.
                                The filters and sorts can be layered or reversed easily.

                                Moreover, I added a button of "apply filters" to give customer full control
                                over what filter combination they want. There's also the "remove all filter" button that will return
                                the display to its default setting.

                            <p>The shopping cart is implemented such that it reflects any immediate changes that the customer has made,
                                including count for each item, and the total price.
                                <br><br>
                                Further, each item in the cart has "add","remove", and "remove all", which allows the customer to manage 
                                contents of the cart without leaving the cart section, making the process of edit the cart much more convenient.

            <h3>Exploring More Types of Components</h3>
            <p class="blah">
                I have used radio select and slider from the React library in this project.
                Going forward I would like to explore more components that can play into 
                the design of my web app. For instance, a drop down menu or a side bar 
                could be a better host of the filter & sort, especially if the number of filter / sort categories grow.
            </p>
            <h3>Increasing Complexity of the Application</h3>
            <p class="blah">
                Currently, every item has a single value for a given attribute. 
                To make this application more realistic, I hope to experiment with
                assigning items multiple values for a given attribute, and implement filter functions based on that.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, I want to learn to implement a recommendation algorithm, 
                potentially leveraging ML and AI technologies, which will make this application more realistic.
