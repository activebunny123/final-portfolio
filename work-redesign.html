            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p class="blah">Online ordering and food delivery has been growing fast as consumers enjoy the convenience, 
                and COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this trend.
                However, many restaurants struggle to provide a versatile online platform that balances between aesthetic, ease of navigation, and information.
                <br><br>
                This is the case with Yan's Cuisine, a Chinese restaurant located near Brown University's campus in Providence, RI.
                Though they have delicious food, their website is hard to navigate.

        <div class="body-item" id="challenge">
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p class="blah">I seek to redesign Yan's website so that it's responsive and can adapt to different devices. 
                Also, I want to improve the layout of Yan's website such that it would be easier for customers to navigate.
                I will incorporate usability and accessibility principles to bring a clearer and more logical hierarchy and information 
                flow to Yan's website, while keeping most of the information from its original site.</p>

                        <p class="ex-description">Before making any design, I want to understand what issues the current website has

                            Thus, I have studied Yan's website under different screen sizes,

                                The breakpoint in screen size is chosen such that when elements do change size 
                                (Ex. h1 changes from 8 to 9 to 11vw for larger, medium, and small screen), the size increase wouldn't be too drastic.</p>

            <h3>Trade off Between Information and Clarity</h3>
            <p class="blah">During the design process, 
                I have considered various choices regarding information preservation
                and the simplicity of the webpage. 
                The original home page has all the menu items listed out on a side bar,
                which not only presents readability issues but is also unnecessary, 
                as customers can always navigate to the menu page.
                Therefore, the redesign completely ditched the side-bar menu,
                and used a menu button at the most eye-catching position of the page instead.
                <br><br>
                I learned that webpage design should always consider what information is necessary,
                and what is redundant, and thus can be removd. This ensures the audience isn't bombarded 
                by too many pieces of information at once, 
                improving the ease of navigation and the overall experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Responsive Elements</h3>
            <p class="blah"> In order to make the webpage responsive,
                I made two versions of the navigation bar (expanded and hamburger menu), 
                and I used variable font sizes.
                One challenge I faced when designing the webpage was to make the transition of font size
                as smooth as possible when device dimension changes. It took many rounds of trial and error
                to figure out the right sizes.
                Even though the variable fonts worked for the majority of the content, the navigation bar 
                became either too small or too crowded for the small screen size. 
                Thus, I created a collapsable hamburger menu that replaces the navigation bar for smaller screens.
                <br><br>
                This experience taught me that UIUX design comes with repeated experimentation, 
                and sometimes elements changes based on external variables (screen size in this case).
