            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p class="blah">
                The drink dispensers in Brown University's Sharpe Refactory dining hall
                are the go-to places for students and staff looking for a refreshing drink 
                to quench their thirst or add some flavor to their meals.
                However, those drink dispensers have interfaces that can be hard to operate and sometimes bring 
                frustration to students. 
                <br><br>
                Therefore, I want to understand the exact functionality of the drink dispensers' interface,
                and the sore spots for users.

            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p class="blah">
                I seek to conduct a user research among the students that interact with the drink dispensers' interface,
                and learn about their experience. Then, I will analyze the users' feedback and construct personas and storyboard,
                which will help to uncover areas of improvement for the interface.

                        <p>
                            The drink dispenser provides various drinks. 
                            Its default home screen shows buttons for water, other drinks, and filter options. 
                            A grey drink button indicates unavailability. 
                            Once a button is pressed, it proceeds to a drink screen that 
                            shows flavor options and calorie information. 
                            After making the final selection, 
                            the user can press their cups against outlets for either ice or drink.
                        </p>

                        <ul class="row-start-container" id="preliminary-analysis">
                            <li class="preliminary-analysis-item"><p style="font-weight:400;">Learnability</p>
                                Many options crowded on the homepage, 
                                first-time users under time constraint may not be 
                                able to see the grouping relationship. Based on personal experience, the users
                                should be able to operate without difficulty after a few times.
                            </li>

                                Shouldn't be an issue as most 
                                users interact with the drink dispenser at least a few times a week.

                                The home page doesn't reflect unavailable 
                                flavors and the filter options are very small. 
                                Those can interfere with users' experience.
